Sub-directory containing the expansion and pre-force input files
necessary to run the Hi-COLA simulations contained elsewhere
in these directories. The ESS files were generated by Ashim
using an early version of the current frontend, whereas all
the other files were generated by Bill using functions
hardcoded for cubic Galileon gravity (see scripts within
../python_scripts/ for this code).
